# Lung-Cancer-prediction-using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms

In my lung cancer prediction project, I utilized various machine learning algorithms including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes (NB), Random Forest, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), XGBoost, and Logistic Regression. The model achieved an accuracy of 98.1%, demonstrating its effectiveness in early detection of lung cancer. This high accuracy underscores the potential of machine learning in improving diagnostic processes and patient outcomes.
